Teensy Key
----------
This project started out as a simple demonstration of the Teensy++ 2.0's 
USB HID capabilities, and has turned out to be a uniquely useful tool.

The Teensy Key project emulates a USB Keyboard and enters a string (with 
newline) after a pre-determined delay. 

The intended purpose is to provide the one-time Disk Encryption Key for Linux 
Systems that use Full Disk Encryption, in order to allow the machines to 
restart without user intervention.

Background
----------

I personally use Full Disk Encryption on my Linux machines, especially laptops
that I carry to on-site projects. Other machines are "loaners" I leave on-site
to handle things like Samba Shares, Backups, and RSync file synchronizations.

One unfortunate side-effect of using Full Disk Encryption is that someone 
must be at the system console at boot time to enter the password to get 
the machine started from a fresh reboot.

Avoiding Reboots can be a problem for Loaner PCs, if power is ever cut,
or some other reason forces the machine to reboot.  Without high-end tools
to provide remote console access, there's no easy way to enter the password
without having someone go to the console and type it in.

With a Teensy++ 2.0 loaded with this program (and the correct password), you
can wire it up to a USB port inside the box, and nobody would be the wiser.

At best, this quick project makes for an EASY stop-gap solution for an 
otherwise difficult problem.

Have Fun!
